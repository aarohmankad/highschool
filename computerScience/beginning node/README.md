# Building a Simple File Server

1. Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Replace this index.html with whatever project you have (remember to also drag in assets!)

3. In this directory, using Git Bash, run the command

  `node app.js`

4. This will run the server file, and you can now navigate to localhost:8080 to see your app.
